= Closeness Centrality

// tag::introduction[]
_Closeness Centrality_ is a way of detecting nodes that are able to spread information very efficiently through a graph.

The _Closeness Centrality_ of a node measures its average distance to all other nodes.
Nodes with a high closeness score have the shortest distances to all other nodes.
// end::introduction[]

== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]
For each node the algorithm calculates the sum of its distances to all other nodes based on calculating shortest paths between all pairs of nodes.
The closeness centrality of a node is sometimes referred to as the node's 'farness'.
// end::explanation[]

// tag::formula[]
The *raw closeness centrality* of a node is calculated using the following formula:

`raw closeness centrality(node) = 1 / sum(distance from node to all other nodes)`

The greater the raw closeness centrality, the longer it takes for information originating at random points in the graph to arrive at the node.

Raw closeness centrality is an inverse measure of centrality.
i.e. nodes with smaller scores are the most central.
It is therefore more common to calculate the *normalized closeness centrality* score where nodes with a higher score are more central.

The formula for *normalized closeness centrality* is as follows:

`normalized closeness centrality(node) = (number of nodes - 1) / sum(distance from node to all other nodes)`
// end::formula[]

== Use-cases - when to use the Closeness Centrality algorithm

// tag::use-case[]

* Closeness centrality is used to research organizational networks where individuals with high closeness centrality are in a favourable position to control and acquire vital information and resources within the organization.
One such study is http://www.orgnet.com/MappingTerroristNetworks.pdf[Mapping Networks of Terrorist Cells by Valdis E. Krebs^].

* Closeness centrality can be interpreted as an estimated time of arrival of information flowing through telecommunications or package delivery networks where information flows through shortest paths to a predefined target.
It can also be used in networks where information spreads through all shortest paths simultaneously such as infection spreading through a social network.
Find more details in http://www.analytictech.com/borgatti/papers/centflow.pdf[Centrality and network flow] by Stephen P. Borgatti.

* Closeness centrality has been used to estimate the importance of words in a document based on a graph-based keyphrase extraction process.
This process is described by Florian Boudin in https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/I/I13/I13-1102.pdf[A Comparison of Centrality Measures for Graph-Based Keyphrase Extraction].

== Constraints - when not to use the Closeness Centrality algorithm

// tag::constraint[]
Academically closeness centrality works best on connected graphs.
If we use the original formula on an unconnected graph we can end up with an infinite distance between two nodes in separate connected components.
This means that we'll end up with an infinite closeness centrality score when we sum up all the distances from that node.

In practice, a variation on the original formula is used so that we don't run into these issues.

"C" is the best connected node in this graph although "B" and "D" aren't far behind.
"A" and "E" don't have close ties to many other nodes so their scores are lower.
A score of 1 would indicate that a node has a direct connection to all other nodes.

Calculation:


- count farness in each msbfs-callback
- divide by N-1

`N = 5`        // number of nodes

`k = N-1 = 4`  // used for normalization

== Huge graph projection

If our projected graph contains more than 2 billion nodes or relationships, we need to use huge graph projection, as the default label and relationship-type projection has a limitation of 2 billion nodes and 2 billion relationships.
Set `graph:'huge'` in the config.

== Cypher projection

If label and relationship-type are not selective enough to describe your subgraph to run the algorithm on, you can use Cypher statements to load or project subsets of your graph.
Can be also used to run algorithms on a virtual graph.
Set `graph:'cypher'` in the config.

We support the following versions of the closeness centrality algorithm:

* [x] directed, unweighted

* [ ] directed, weighted

* [x] undirected, unweighted

** Only with cypher projection

== Implementation details

:leveloffset: +1
// copied from: https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graph-algorithms/issues/99

_Closeness Centrality_ of a node is a measure of centrality in a network, calculated as the sum of the length of the shortest paths between the node and all other nodes in the graph.
Thus the more central a node is, the closer it is to all other nodes.

== Details

- use `org.neo4j.graphalgo.impl.msbfs.MultiSourceBFS` for BFS
- MSBFS gives depth and number of sources.
- in this scheme the farness can be calculated as follows

 farness(v) = farness(v) + numberOfSources(v) * depth(v)
