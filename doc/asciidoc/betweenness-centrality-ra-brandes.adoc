= Approximation of Betweenness Centrality

// tag::introduction[]
As mentioned above, calculating the exact betweenness centrality on large graphs can be very time consuming.
We might therefore choose to use an approximation algorithm that will run much quicker and still give us useful information.
// end::introduction[]

== RA-Brandes algorithm

// tag::explanation[]
The RA-Brandes algorithm is the best known one for calculating an approximate score for betweenness centrality.
Rather than calculating the shortest path between every pair of nodes, the RA-Brandes algorithm consider only a subset of nodes.
Two common strategies for selecting the subset of nodes are:

* random: nodes are selected uniformly at random with defined probability of selection. The default probability is `log10(N) / e^2`. If the probability is 1 then the algorithm works the same was as the normal betweenness centrality algorithm where all nodes are loaded.

* degree: first calculates the mean degree of the nodes and then only visits nodes whose degree is higher then the mean. i.e. only dense nodes are visited

As a further optimisation we might choose to limit the depth used by the shortest path algorithm.
// end::explanation[]
This can be controlled by the `maxDepth` parameter.
